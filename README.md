# streamsplit-Funding 🏗🧬

this is an  application being created for hackFS hackathon , which is an web application integrated with the  payment splitting contract , which  allows the funding entities / scientists to give grants to the corresponding refarences for the paper with certain proportions , the idea is to define the possible funding channels to incentivise scientific paper study and referencing of the papers to have more better reputation mechanisms.
